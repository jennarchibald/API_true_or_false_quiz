# API_true_or_false_quiz

This project is a simple true or false quiz in the browser. Written in javascript and using the [Open Trivia Database API](https://opentdb.com/) as a source of questions.

This project was written in response to a homework brief in week 7 of CodeClan's professional software development course:

"Your task is to create an application that makes a request to an API and displays the data."

I chose to make a quiz as I wanted to make something which would be interactive for the user and try some more challenging coding such as keeping score and timing the quiz.

Further steps for this project I would like to try out would be taking advantage of the multiple choice questions available from the API. This would allow more user interaction in designing the quiz as it would allow for a choice of question types as well as question quantity.
